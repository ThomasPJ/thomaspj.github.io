          .brief
            p.highlight My objective for this project was to develop my scrum mastering skills and understand the concepts of MVP, sprints and retros.
            p 
              | Our mission was to showcase the vibrancy and dynamism of the 
              a(href="http://www.pci-group.com/PCIprojects/569-great-northern-way/" target="_blank") future Great Northern Way.
              |  We chose to develop a tablet application to provide the public and potential tenants with an interactive experience to understand GNWâ€™s potential to truly become a vibrant and thriving creative community.
            p I lead a team of 5 in developing a tablet application for PCI as part of my industry project at the Centre for Digital Media. Our team was composed of 2 developers, a UX designer and a UI designer. 
            p I lead our sprint planning, review and retro sessions and I was our client's primary point of contact throughout the whole semester. I managed both the art pipeline and the technical pipeline (milestone definition, issue tracking...) and organised our final demo & delivery.
          .conclusion
            p Throughout the project we learned how to strip our design down to the essentials, and designate a clear focus for each iteration in order to prove and validate our concept with our client. This helped us prioritize better and design a stronger MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that focused on the core idea. We also managed to provide our client with a roadmap for future developments, to allow them to plan future iterations.
