          h3 HarpJS

            target="_blank",
            rel="nofollow noopener",
            title="Harp Github Repo") Harp
            | , a very cool static site server / generator. Harp compiles Jade, Markdown, Stylus and Sass out of the box and creates static assets in a blink of an eye. I really like how lightweight and straightforward it is, you can get started in seconds without any configuration, all the magic happens in the background. No fancy web framework here, just simple front-end publishing.

            | . Aside from the technical implementation itself, I'm interested to see how Google will process my new AMP blog posts. Does it index those pages faster than regular pages? Will the rest of my website benefit from it? Wait and see.

            title="ThomasPJ / Travis Github commit page") I recently tried to link my repo's dev branch to Travis CI
            | . My goal is to have Travis handle the "gulp" and "gulp deploy" tasks right after my commits (kind of like Jekyll). This would save me a lot of time and make my workflow much smoother. Unfortunately my first attempts have failed.
