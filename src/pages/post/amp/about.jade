      h2.title-amp Hi I'm Thomas
      .content-amp
        p I'm a search engine optimizer and a project manager with over 3 years of experience. I graduated from The University of Nottingham in 2014 with a BSc in Management. I am currently a graduate student at the

        p I first entered the digital media industry as a front-end developer which allowed me to develop key technical skills in web programming. I've developed web applications using HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS / Redux and jQuery.
        h2.brief-nutshell 2014 - 2016
        p I learned about search engine marketing (SEO & SEA) first as a freelance web consultant and then as an SEO Consultant at altima, a global agency specialised in e-commerce. I had the chance to pitch to a variety of different clients and work with multidisciplinary teams (Front-End/Back-End developers, UX designers, art directors, CROs...).
        p During my time at altima, I had the chance to manage different e-commerce related projects, such as the design and development of in-store mobile applications and e-commerce platforms, for well established brands in the luxury industry and the travel sector.
        h2.brief-nutshell 2016 - 2017
        p The Master of Digital Media program has helped me improve my 
          em collaborative skills
          |  and leadership abilities. I've had the chance to facilitate a number of different workshops both for my teams and for clients and I've worked as a scrum master on a number of different projects. This program has pushed me outside of my comfort zone and has made me think of better ways to work collaboratively.
