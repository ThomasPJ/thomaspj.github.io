      h1.title-amp Hi I'm Thomas
      .content-amp
        p I'm a search engine optimizer and a project manager with over 3 years of experience. I graduated from The University of Nottingham in 2014 with a BSc in Management. I am currently a graduate student at the Centre for Digital Media in Vancouver, BC.
        h2.brief-nutshell Front-End development
        p I first entered the digital media industry as a front-end developer which allowed me to develop key technical skills in web programming. I have developed web applications using HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS / Redux and jQuery.
        h2.brief-nutshell Search Marketing
        p I learned about search marketing (SEO & SEA) as a freelance web consultant. Working as an independent consultant was certainly one of my most enriching and challenging experiences. I had the chance to pitch to a variety of different clients and work with multidisciplinary teams (Front-End/Back-End developers, UX designers, art directors, CROs...). 
        h2.brief-nutshell Project Management
        p My latest experience was working as a project manager for altima, a global digital agency based in Paris. During that time, I managed different e-commerce related projects, such as the design and development of in-store mobile applications and e-commerce platforms, for well established brands in the luxury industry and the travel sector.
        h2.brief-nutshell The MDM program
        p Through my master, I am looking to improve my collaborative skills and leadership abilities. I've had the chance to facilitate a number of different workshops both for my teams and for clients. I've also worked as a scrum master on two different industry projects. This pushed me outside my comfort zone and made me think of better ways to work collaboratively.
        p Find me on
